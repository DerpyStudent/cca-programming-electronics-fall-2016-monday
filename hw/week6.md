### Homework 6 (due Sunday, October 23, 2016)

This week's homework is to continue making progress on your collaborative project skull. By next week, you should have a functional prototype, ready for your partner to put the finishing touches on.

In addition, to prepare for the upcoming in-class examination, complete this [practice quiz](practice-quiz.pdf). Instructions:

- The in-class examination will be open-book, open-notes, but closed-computer. (No digital devices will be allowed.) The format will be very similar to this practice quiz.

- To complete the practice quiz, give yourself 2 hours, don't use your computer, and use whatever notes you plan to bring to the midterm.

- Scan (or photograph with your cell phone) your completed practice quiz and [email it to us](mailto:jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu,mshiloh@cca.edu) (don't put this in github) by Sunday night, 11:59pm on October 23.
